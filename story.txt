In the little tree town, a gnome by the name of Rusty tended to the trees. Every morning he would
carry his trusty toolbox and water pail to fix/grow any trees that needed attention for the day. 
Each tree was unique, sometimes a tree needed some water, other times a brace to help heal a 
broken branch, and other times a firm pat by ole Rusty to reassure the tree. But there was one
tree that had always stumped Rusty. No amount of water, fixin, or pats on the root would help
this tree get better. However, on this morning the tree had decided to surpise our friend Rusty.

Today, the tree looked just like the others around it. Upon closer inspection though, Rusty could 
tell that the tree was struggling to remain upgright, as if its roots had disappeared. Rusty leaned
in for a closer look.
