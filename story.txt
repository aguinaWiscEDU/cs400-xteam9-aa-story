In the little tree town, a gnome by the name of Rusty tended to the trees. Every morning he would
carry his trusty toolbox and water pail to fix/grow any trees that needed attention for the day. 
Each tree was unique, sometimes a tree needed some water, other times a brace to help heal a 
broken branch, and other times a firm pat by ole Rusty to reassure the tree. But there was one
tree that had always stumped Rusty. No amount of water, fixin, or pats on the root would help
this tree get better. However, on this morning the tree had decided to surpise our friend Rusty.

Today, the tree looked just like the others around it. Upon closer inspection though, Rusty could 
tell that the tree was struggling to remain upgright, as if its roots had disappeared. Rusty leaned
in for a closer look.

Rusty was astounded by what he saw. A horde of beetles had devoured most of the tree's roots.
Rusty immediately started trying to shoo the beetles away but to no avail. He would need to resort to more drastic measures.

Rummaging through his trusty toolbox, he pulled out his latest invention, the BeetleWacker9000. Giving it the necessary fuel
he turned the device on and let it run its magic. The 9000 immediately sputtered on and began to carefully grab each and 
every beetle with furious speed. Rusty smiled as he saw the number of beetles slowly went to 0. 

As the last beetle was picked up Rusty immediately grabbed the device and carefully shut it off. While the tree was barely
standing, with some firm attention and care, Rusty could successfully save this tree.
